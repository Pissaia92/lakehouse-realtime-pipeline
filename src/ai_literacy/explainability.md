# IA Literacy: How Predictions Work

This pipeline uses a simple rule-based model to classify orders as 'High' or 'Low' based on amount.

- If amount > 100 → High Value
- Else → Low Value

No complex ML model is used — just clear business logic.

For real models, SHAP/LIME can be added to explain predictions.
